# Walkthrough: Zagara B2B Lookbook

I have successfully implemented the "Digital Sculpture Garden" website for Zagara by Oraklı Tekstil. The site embodies the avant-garde, ultra-luxury aesthetic requested, functioning as an immersive B2B lookbook.

## Key Features

### 1. The Digital Sculpture Garden Aesthetic
-   **Visuals**: Monochromatic palette (Concrete, Alabaster, Charcoal).
-   **Typography**: Combination of `Syne` (Brutalist Display) and `Inter` (Utilitarian Sans).
-   **Texture**: Soft concrete and fine art paper backgrounds for tactile depth.

### 2. Immersive Interactions
-   **Magnetic Cursor**: A custom cursor that tracks movement and reacts to interactive elements, enhancing the "physical" feel of browsing.
-   **Liquid Motion**: Implemented `lenis` for buttery smooth, momentum-based scrolling.
-   **Reveal Animations**: Section-by-section reveal animations using `framer-motion`.

### 3. Core Sections
-   **Hero**: Full-screen architectural gown presentation. Minimalist branding.
-   **Heritage**: Dedicated textile craftsmanship section with extreme macro photography.
-   **Collection Preview**: Asymmetrical, editorial layout ("The Anti-Grid") with floating elements.
-   **B2B Contact**: Minimalist footer focused on wholesale inquiries and showroom appointments.
-   **Multi-language Support (TR/EN)**: Full bilingual support with dynamic content switching and localized form fields.
-   **Visual Refinements**: "Liquid Glass" apple-style navbar, custom Z-monogram favicon, and optimized typographic hierarchy.

## Verification
-   **Build Status**: Successful (`npm run build`).
-   **Responsiveness**: Layout adapts to mobile (vertical stacking) while maintaining the editorial feel.

## Next Steps for User
-   **Content Entry**: All site content (Collections, About, Home) is now final and populated with real data.
-   **Structure**: Footer updated (Headquarters/LinkedIn removed, Instagram link added).
-   **Deployment**: Ready for deployment to Vercel/Netlify.
-   **Integration**: Formspree is active.
