# Deployment Guide: Zagara B2B Lookbook

Your project is built with **Vite + React**, which makes it a "Static Site". This means it can be deployed very easily and for free on modern hosting platforms.

## Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)
Vercel is the creators of Next.js and provides the best experience for React apps.

1.  **Create a Repository**: Push your project code to a GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository.
2.  **Sign Up/Login**: Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in.
3.  **Add New Project**: Click "Add New..." -> "Project".
4.  **Import**: Select your `zagara` repository.
5.  **Configure**: Vercel will automatically detect `Vite`.
    -   **Framework Preset**: Vite
    -   **Build Command**: `npm run build`
    -   **Output Directory**: `dist`
6.  **Deploy**: Click "Deploy". It will take about 1 minute.

## Option 2: Netlify
Netlify is another excellent option for static sites.

1.  **Push to Git**: Ensure your code is on GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.
2.  **Sign Up**: Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com).
3.  **New Site**: Click "Add new site" -> "Import from existing project".
4.  **Connect**: Choose your Git provider and select the repo.
5.  **Settings**: Netlify usually auto-detects, but if asked:
    -   **Build command**: `npm run build`
    -   **Publish directory**: `dist`
6.  **Deploy**: Click "Deploy site".

## Manual Build (Already Run)
I have already run `npm run build` locally to verify there are no errors. The `dist` folder in your project now contains the optimized production files.
